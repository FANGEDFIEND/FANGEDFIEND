Too wavy and I'm feelin' gnarly (Like)

No soda, th–µ ceiling is starry (Grrah)

I'm a baddie, I'm rockin' Ed Hardy

I'm a baddie, l'm lat–µ to the party (Ugh)

Body nice and I got that shit on (Damn)

Came in like I'm '03 LeBron (Grrah)

Too pretty, can't do nothin' wrong (Like)

Butterfly tat' sit on top of my thong

And I just throw it back, let it shake

If I'm feelin' down, I just look in my safe

Like‚Äî (Grrah), like, yes, I'm a ten in the face

I got that shit that you cannot replace
